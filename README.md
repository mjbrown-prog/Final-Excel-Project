# RESOLUTION/RECOMMENDATION

- Their should be More Advert to show other products which are lacking in sales.
- The states with the lowest sales should be visited which i suggest the do more campaign and Ads for visibility.
- The need to go back to the drawing board to know what happened as the trend across revenue sales was reduced as the year goes by, so it will be advised to go back to year 2014 to know how the revenue sales was generated and inestigate to know where losses are made in other not to reoccur in the coming year.
- The should run more campaign and adverts in the Central Region in order to generate more profit.
